This project is currently under construction based on the pathfinding tutorial of Cl√©ment Mihailescu (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msttfIHHkak). I am using the provided starter code for the rectangle grid, and building upon that to visualize the algorithms I find interesting. Currently, breadth first search (BFS) and depth first search (DFS) are implemented. I will add the algorithms listed below in the near future:

- A\*
- Dijkstra's
- Some more cool algorithms

Please feel free to try out the DFS and BFS visualizers using this link: https://hampusrosvall.github.io/graphsearch-visualizer/. Press reset grid button in between runs. Happy visualizing! :)
