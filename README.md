This project is currently under construction based on the pathfinding tutorial of Cl√©ment Mihailescu (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msttfIHHkak). I am using the provided starter code for the rectangle grid, and building upon that to visualize the algorithms I find interesting. Currently, I have finished breadth first search and I will add 

* Depth first search 
* A* 
* Dijkstra's 
* Some more cool algorithms
